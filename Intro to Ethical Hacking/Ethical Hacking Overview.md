# Ethical Hacking Overview

## Attacks

There are two types of attacks:
1. Passive
2. Active

## Evolution of Malware

- Becoming mroe aggressive and sophisticated
- network-based ransomware worms to wiper malware
- polymorphic: the signatures are constantly changing
- this behavior makes malware detection more difficult

## Using Encryption to Evade Detection

- Malicious actors use encryption to conceal malicious activity
- communicating with a command-and-control server
- moving through your network in the form of an APT

## Burst Attack Signatures

- attacks that send large amounts of packets in a short time frame to shutdown a service
- Ex: DDoS Attacks

## Navigating Attack Vectors

Goal: Deliver a malicious payload or perpetrate malicious acts by taking advantage of vulnerabilities to gain entry.

Old School viruses are declining, while malware is becoming more aggressive via trojan horses, rootkits, and spyware.

### Attack Vector: Email and Email Attachments 

- one of the original methods to send malware
- becoming more sophisticated
- modern malware is polymorphic
- Minimize:
	- keep antivirus updates
	- educate users to use caution

### Attack Vector: Webpages and Pop-Ups

- when clicker, malware can install: 
	- spyware
	- adware
	- hijackers
	- dialers
	- trojans
	- other malware
- Minimize:
	- stay away from risky websites

### Attack Vector: Wireless Networks

- pervasive
- insecure by nature
- use secure connections to prevent attack

## Comparing Attack Types

### Brute Force

- brute force tries all combinations
- dictionary attack: a subset of brute force

### Reconnaissance

- passive attack
- sniffing and scanning
- gain information about the network

### Denial of Service (DoS)

- disrupt a service by locking out legitimate users
- Session Initiation Protocol (SIP): set up, maintain, and end sessions for protocols such as VoIP and IM
- SIP flood: floods the client with multiple invite messages in order to take down the phone

### Malware

- viruses, worms, trojan horses
- ransomware and spyware
- scripts and executables
- active web content
- hybrid, polymorphic, and fileless

### Viruses and Womrs

- a virus can self-replicate and spread to other programs
- a worm can spread without any help
